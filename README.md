# Insect-Pest-Classification
Deep learning-based insect pest species identification using the IP102 dataset (102 species). Compared multiple CNN architectures including ResNet50, DenseNet121, EfficientNet-B0, and MobileNetV2. Proposed a novel dual-stream fusion model integrating Swin Transformer and BEiT, achieving improved classification performance over baseline models.
